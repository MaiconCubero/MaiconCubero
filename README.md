# Hi, I'm Maicon 

## AI Developer

I'm a developer focused on **AI-assisted software development**, using artificial intelligence as a practical tool to design, build, and improve software solutions.

My approach is simple:  
use AI to **work smarter**, automate repetitive tasks, integrate systems, and accelerate problem-solving — without losing control over code quality or logic.

## What I do

- AI-assisted development (code, debugging, refactoring)
- Task automation and internal tools
- API integrations
- Scripts to improve productivity and workflows

I see AI as a **development accelerator**, not a replacement for engineering fundamentals.

Every project here reflects **hands-on usage**, not theoretical experiments.
