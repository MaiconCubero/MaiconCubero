# Maicon's GitHub Profile

## About Me
I'm Maicon, an AI Developer with roots in technical support for telecom. I've spent years troubleshooting real-world issues, from network diagnostics to process optimization. Now, I'm channeling that into AI—specifically agentic AI, where systems act independently to get things done.

Forget the "prompt engineer" label; it's outdated and misses the point. True AI development isn't about tweaking chatbots or riding hype waves. It's about engineering robust, autonomous agents that integrate with tools, reason through tasks, and deliver measurable value. I build these using frameworks like LangChain, PyTorch, and custom orchestration—no shortcuts, just solid code.

## Why Agentic AI?
In 2026, AI isn't magic; it's engineering. Agentic systems (think self-operating agents that plan, execute, and adapt) are where the real impact happens. They automate workflows in telecom, finance, or any field needing efficiency. My projects aim to prove this: practical tools that work, not demos.

## Key Projects
- **Telecom Diagnostic Agent**: An autonomous agent that analyzes network logs, simulates failures, and suggests fixes—built with Python and ML models.
- **Process Optimizer**: Agent for streamlining support tickets, reducing manual steps by 50% in simulations.
- More coming: Focused on eSIM testing and MVNO support automation.

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, JavaScript
- AI/ML: PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangGraph
- Tools: AWS, Docker for deployment
- Approach: Code-first, test-driven, open-source when possible.
